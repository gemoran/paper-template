# paper-template

This is a template for writing a research paper. The template includes directory structure and some Latex helpers---style and macros.

When writing a paper with me, start by cloning this repo.

File structure:
- `/src` : all code for project 
- `/doc` : all writing (each version should have its own folder e.g. `doc/arxiv/v1/`
- `/dat` : demo data (IMPORTANT: no large data files here)
- `/out`: output to make the figures (IMPORTANT: no large data files here)
- `/etc`: other stuff (pictures of whiteboards, text files, and so on)

For large files you need locally, add them to `.gitignore` to make sure they are not tracked.
